**Wireless Bluetooth Earphone Documentation**

*Project Overview*
We have successfully converted a wired earphone into a wireless Bluetooth earphone using various electronic components, including a Bluetooth Stereo Module, Charging Module, 150 mAh LiPo rechargeable battery, Non-Locking DPDT (Double Pole Double Throw) switch, and the wired earphone itself. This transformation allows the earphone to connect wirelessly to devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops, offering the convenience of Bluetooth connectivity without the hassle of tangled wires.

**Components Used**:

| Components                              | Usecase                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. *Bluetooth Stereo Module:*           | This module enables wireless audio streaming via Bluetooth. It pairs with devices like smartphones , Laptops, etc and delivers stereo sound to the earphones.                                                          |
| 2. *Charging Module* (Micro-USB type):* | The charging module manages the LiPo battery charging with a micro-USB port, LED indicator for charging status, and built-in power management for consistent output, overcharge protection, and efficient performance. |
| 3. *150 mAh LiPo Rechargeable Battery:* | The battery powers the Bluetooth module and provides several hours of continuous playtime before needing a recharge.                                                                                                   |
| 4. *Non-Locking DPDT Switch:*           | This switch is used to control the power to the Bluetooth module. It allows easy switching between "on" and "off" states without locking into a position.                                                              |
| 5. *Wired Earphone:*                    | The standard wired earphones are used, but the auxiliary (AUX) cable is replaced with the Bluetooth module, making the earphones wireless.                                                                             |
|                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

**Working Principle**:

In this project, we replaced the AUX cable of the wired earphones with a wireless module device that includes the Bluetooth stereo receiver, the power supply in the form of a rechargeable battery, and other necessary modules for smooth operation.
The Bluetooth Stereo Module receives audio signals wirelessly from a Bluetooth-enabled device (e.g., smartphone). These signals are then transmitted to the earphone speakers, just like a typical wired connection would. The Charging Module is connected to the battery, ensuring that the power is maintained for the Bluetooth module. The battery can be recharged as needed.
The Non-Locking DPDT switch acts as a power control mechanism, allowing the user to turn the device on or off conveniently.

**Assembly Process**

1. Disassemble the Wired Earphones:
First, carefully cut off the AUX cable near the 3.5 mm jack, leaving enough wire to solder the Bluetooth module.

2. Connect Bluetooth Stereo Module:
Solder the wires from the earphones to the output terminals of the Bluetooth stereo module, ensuring left and right audio channels are connected properly.

3. Battery and Charging Module Setup:
- Connect the 150 mAh LiPo battery to the power input of the Bluetooth module, using the charging module to handle battery management.
- Make sure the charging module can connect to an external charger (usually via micro-USB or Type-C).

4. Integrating the DPDT Switch:
Install the DPDT switch in the circuit to control the on/off function of the Bluetooth module, ensuring it is easily accessible.

5. Enclosure Design:
Place all components (Bluetooth module, charging module, battery, and switch) in a compact and portable enclosure. The enclosure should be light and comfortable for daily use.

6. Testing:
After assembling, pair the Bluetooth earphones with a mobile device and test audio output. Ensure that the sound quality is stable, and the wireless connection is reliable.

**Conclusion**

This project transforms a regular wired earphone into a wireless Bluetooth earphone using readily available components. The device is now capable of streaming high-quality stereo audio wirelessly from any Bluetooth-enabled device. The addition of a rechargeable battery and charging module ensures that the earphone can be used for extended periods before requiring a recharge.
